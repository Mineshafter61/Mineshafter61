## About me
Owns the [Limaru City Server](https://mineshafter61.github.io/LimaruSite). Likes trains. A lot. Created the Krepian language. Discord: https://discord.gg/ykrbZga

## Coding style
Variable names must always be in CamelCase. Use 2 spaces instead of tabs. If-else format:
```c++
if (condition) {
  // statements
}
else if {
  // statements
}
else {
  // statements
}
```
For Python, use underscores instead of CamelCase, except in the case of Classes.

If the statement in an if-else block has only 1 line, put it on the same line as the condition. This also applies for loops. Always use a for-loop whenever possible. Use an underscore (if the language allows) for variables that will never be used but must be present for code to work.

## Versioning
For projects that depend on someone else's project completely: `<that project's version><r/b/a/d><my project's version (just a single number)`

For my projects that do not depend/partially depend on someone else's project: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>d<snapshot>`

r/b/a/d:
- r stands for release, and is used for stable releases.
- b stands for beta, and is used for generally stable releases (more bugs may be present)
- a stands for alpha, and is used for unstable releases (may not be fully tested)
- d stands for dev, and is used for untested versions. 'd' versions usually have two numbers, e.g. r2d2 for release 2 dev 2 (second build of release 2)

A typical versioning progression goes like this:

`a1 -> a2 -> a2d2 -> a3 -> b3 -> b3d2 -> a4 -> b4 -> r4 -> a5 (and so on)`

Two versions with the same number (that is, the number after r/b/a) will have the same features. They will only have a different number of bugs (alpha versions have the most bugs). It is possible for the next release version to have a different number from its beta, e.g. `b4 -> r5` if there are minor features added.
